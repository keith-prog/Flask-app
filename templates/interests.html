    <h4>Fine Dining</h4>
        <p>My interests outside of my course and computers are many. Most of which I cannot afford to indulge in. A huge interest I have is fine dinning. When I was a chef I would usually have one night off and I try to find the best restaurant in the area and have a three to four course meal. When I lived in New York City there were plenty of high quality resauratnts to choose from.
             Some of my favorite New York restaurants are <a href="https://www.jean-georgesrestaurant.com/jean-georges/" target="_blank">Jean-Georges</a> , <a href="https://www.danielnyc.com/" target="_blank">Daniel</a> and <a href="https://www.le-bernardin.com/" target="_blank">Le Bernardin</a>. The last time I was working and could afford to go out to a good restaurant once a week I was on the island of Saba. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saba" target="_blank">Saba</a>
             is a very small island in the Caribbean with a population under two thousand. So as you could imagine there weren't to many restaurants on the island let alone great restaurants. The restaurants I liked in Saba were <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ie/ShowUserReviews-g147337-d1046542-r383543989-Brigadoon-Windwardside_Saba.html" target="_blank">The Brigadoon</a> and <a href="">Chez Bubba Bistro
            </a>. Unfortunately at the moment I cannot afford to partake in the fine dinning experience unless I cook for myself and that just defeats the purpose.</p>
     <h4>Sailing</h4>
     <p>When I was young, I loved to sail regattas which is basically sailboat racing, and I am still very interested in sailing today. My brother just bought a sailboat and sailed from New York to Florida and visited friends and ports along the way.
          We had plans to sail to the Caribbean after high school but his girlfriend who was on the pill got pregnant, I digress. I enjoy watching videos he sent me and also there are some sailors on YouTube I like to follow as they sail around the world.</p>
    <p>Sam Holmes is one of the sailors I like to watch on YouTube he is currently sailing from Ireland to Scotland in search of whiskey distilleries <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzD6J8Wbb8g" target="_blank">click here</a> to see a Sam Holmes video</p>
