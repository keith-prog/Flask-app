    <h4>Fine Dining</h4>
        <p>My interests outside of my course and computers are many. Most of which I cannot afford to indulge in. A huge interest I have is fine dinning. When I was a chef I would usually have one night off and I try to find the best restaurant in the area and have a three to four course meal. When I lived in New York City there were plenty of high quality resauratnts to choose from.
             Some of my favorite New York restaurants are <a href="https://www.jean-georgesrestaurant.com/jean-georges/" target="_blank">Jean-Georges</a> , <a href="https://www.danielnyc.com/" target="_blank">Daniel</a> and <a href="https://www.le-bernardin.com/" target="_blank">Le Bernardin</a>. The last time I was working and could afford to go out to a good restaurant once a week I was on the island of Saba. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saba" target="_blank">Saba</a>
             is a very small island in the Caribbean with a population under two thousand. So as you could imagine there weren't to many restaurants on the island let alone great restaurants. The restaurants I liked in Saba were <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.ie/ShowUserReviews-g147337-d1046542-r383543989-Brigadoon-Windwardside_Saba.html" target="_blank">The Brigadoon</a> and <a href="">Chez Bubba Bistro
            </a>. Unfortunately at the moment I cannot afford to partake in the fine dinning experience unless I cook for myself and that just defeats the purpose.</p>
